# Guide on Using LIWC
## Introduction to LIWC
### What is LIWC?
LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) is a software tool that analyzes text to provide insights into the psychological state of the author. It categorizes words to reflect emotions, thinking styles, and social concerns​​.
### How LIWC Works
LIWC compares words in a text with its built-in dictionaries, calculating the percentage of words matching each psychological category​​.

## Importing Data into LIWC

### Preparing Your Data
#### Formats Supported by LIWC

- LIWC can import and analyze text data from various file formats including plain text (.txt), Microsoft Word documents (.docx), PDF files, and spreadsheets (CSV, Excel).
- Ensure your text data is saved in one of these formats.

#### Organizing Your Data

- If you have multiple text files, organize them in a single folder for easy access.
- For spreadsheet files, ensure each row corresponds to a separate text entry for analysis. If your data is in paragraphs or longer texts, each should ideally be in a separate row.

#### Tips for Data Preparation

- Remove any unnecessary formatting from Word or PDF documents as LIWC focuses on text content.
- For spreadsheets, clearly label the columns, especially if including additional data like timestamps, author names, etc.

### Importing Process

#### Opening LIWC

- Launch LIWC and navigate to the 'File' menu.
- Select 'Open' or 'Import' to begin the process of importing your text data.

#### Selecting Files

- A file explorer window will open. Navigate to the folder where your text files or spreadsheet are stored.
- You can select multiple text files at once for batch analysis. For spreadsheets, select the file you prepared.

#### Previewing Data

- Once files are selected, LIWC will display a preview of the data.
- This is crucial for ensuring that the text is correctly formatted and ready for analysis.
- Review the preview to make sure that all text appears as expected.

#### Importing Spreadsheet Data

- If you're using a spreadsheet, LIWC will ask you to specify which columns contain the text data for analysis.
- You may have options to treat each cell as a separate text (useful for analyzing individual responses or entries) or to aggregate texts in each row.

#### Adjusting Import Settings

- If your data requires specific settings (like ignoring certain rows or headers), adjust these in the import window.
- LIWC might offer advanced options for handling large datasets or specialized text formats.

#### Finalizing the Import

- Once you're satisfied with the preview and settings, confirm the import.
- LIWC will process the files and add them to your workspace for analysis.

### Troubleshooting Common Import Issues
#### File Format Errors
- If LIWC does not recognize your file, check the file format and convert it to a compatible format if necessary.

#### Encoding Issues
- Text encoding problems can occur, especially with non-English text. Ensure your file's encoding is compatible with LIWC (UTF-8 is commonly used).

#### Incorrect Data Display
- If the data doesn't display correctly in the preview, check for extra spaces, unusual characters, or formatting issues in your original file.
